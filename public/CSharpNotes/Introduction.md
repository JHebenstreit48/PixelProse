# Introduction to C#
<hr>

C# (C Sharp) is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. It is part of the C family of coding languages and is similar to C++ and Java.

## Why Use C#?
- C# provides a clear structure to programs and enables code reuse, which helps lower development costs.
- It is versatile and used to create:

  - Mobile applications
  - Desktop applications
  - Web applications and services
  - Websites
  - Games
  - VR applications
  - Database applications
  </span>

## Basic Language Features
- **Statements**: Every C# statement must end with a semicolon (<span class="punctuationSymbol">;</span>).
- **Case Sensitivity**: C# is case-sensitive. For example, `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are treated as different identifiers.

## Object-Oriented Programming
C# is built on the principles of object-oriented programming, which include:
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details and exposing only what is necessary.
- **Inheritance**: Enabling new classes to derive from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing methods to have different implementations based on the object calling them.

### Classes in C#
Classes are essential to object-oriented programming in C#. They allow you to:
- Define reusable components.
- Encapsulate data and behavior.
- Use inheritance to extend functionality.

# Namespaces in C#

## What Are Namespaces?
Namespaces are containers that organize code and prevent naming conflicts. They can contain:
<span class="bullet2">
- Classes
- Interfaces
- Enums
- Other namespaces
</span>

## Standard and Custom Namespaces
- **Standard Namespaces**: Part of the .NET Framework or .NET Core, these cannot be modified. Examples include `System` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore`.
  <span class="bullet2">
  - `System`: Provides core classes and data types like integers, strings, and arrays.
  - Includes functionalities such as:
    <span class="bullet6">
    - Exception handling
    - Math operations
    - Console interaction
    </span>
  </span>
- **Custom Namespaces**: Developers can define their own namespaces to organize their code.

## Benefits of Using Namespaces
- Avoids naming conflicts in larger projects.
- Makes code easier to read and maintain.
- Allows grouping of related functionalities.

## Alias for Namespaces
To avoid conflicts or simplify usage, namespaces can be aliased using descriptive names for clarity.
