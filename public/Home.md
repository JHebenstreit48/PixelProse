  <span class="emphasis">PC, console, web, and handheld</span> platforms (non-mobile). It organizes
  notes on coding, game design, engines, tools, testing, production phases, and development workflows.
  Mobile game development and mobile app topics are covered separately in AppFoundry.

<div class="Note">
  NOTE: All four projects—PixelProse, NetNotes, DevScriptStax, and AppFoundry—are currently undergoing
  a major refactor of navigation and routes. The primary focus is on granularizing categories and
  subpages, restructuring content for consistency, and implementing lazy-loaded routing across the
  sites.  

  While this structural work is the main priority, new notes and topic pages are also being added in
  parallel, though content expansion is not the central focus at this stage. Use the navigation above
  to explore notes on coding practices, design workflows, engines like Unity and Unreal, game testing,
  production pipelines, and other aspects of non-mobile game development.
