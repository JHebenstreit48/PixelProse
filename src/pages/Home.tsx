                        This site is a React JS version of an original vanilla HTML website I created for a boot camp I recently completed in web development coding/programming.
                    </p>

                    <p className='siteInfoContent'>
                       The site has pages for the different topics I have learned so far. Each page is split up into regular notes without large code snippets and a second page with code snippets.
                       I will continue to expand this site as I learn more about coding and add additional pages for new topics as well as new notes.
